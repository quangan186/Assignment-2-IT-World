              <p class="text">According to my Myers- Briggs test result, my advantage is that I am an extraverted, observant and assertive person. The extravert helps me be trustworthy in other eyes and easy to find support from others when I have difficulty. On the other hand, observation helps me learn and gain more knowledge and life’s experiences so that I can be more assertive when I make any decisions. These strengths help me connect members in my team, make logical decisions, and support members while we are doing projects. However, I need to find 3 members whose strengths are writing reports, collecting and checking report’s mistakes, and designing not only the report but also the slides for the presentation. Luckily, even though it is quite difficult to find teammates this semester because of Covid pandemic, I have found and invited enough teammates whose strengths are similar to what I need after 6 weeks. They are Duong My Uyen, Pham Phuc Binh and Nguyen Phuoc Thanh.

              <p class="text">Last but not least, Uyen is the only girl in my group and she is a polite and enthusiastic person. However, Uyen's Myers- Briggs test result demonstrates that her personality is almost opposite of mine. For instance, Uyen’s result shows that she is an introverted person , and she uses her feelings to make decisions, with 62 percent of introverts  and 64 percent of feelings, while I am an extravert and use thinking to make decisions, about 70 percent of extravert and 52 percent of thinking. In my opinion, it is very interesting to me because it helps me consider carefully before making any decisions for the group. Also, with the advantages that she used to study overseas a long time ago, I believe letting her synthesize our work in the report and check mistakes such as content or grammar is suitable.

        <h2>Rechter</h2>
        <img src="" alt="">
      </div>

      <div class="intro">
        <p>When I was in secondary school, it was the first time that I used the computer to play video games as a way of entertainment after school. Right now, I have owned a huge number of games not only on my computer but also on my game console such as PlayStation 4, Xbox, Gameboy,etc. There are many games with the various categories such as action games (Super Mario Bros, Call of Duty, Resident Evil, etc), Role-playing games (Final Fantasy, League of Legends, The Witcher, etc), sports games (Fifa, NBA, Pro Evolution Soccer, etc), etc. The benefits of playing computer games have been witnessed in society. For instance, games serve as an educational platform to help people improve their organizational skills, as a means of leisure after stressful working hours and as an effective method to learn English. Therefore, I want to develop a game that helps people relax after working in a hectic schedule. Some information about the game will be introduced to help people have an overview of the game.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
          <span class="moreText">
            <h2 id="require"> Overview </h1>
            <p class="text" id="description">In my project, I decided to make a Role-playing game called Rechter. This is a 2D platform game with pixel art. Player will play as a villager called Rechter who will go to the kingdom to work as a soldier in order to have income to support his village. However, after hearing the kingdom's situation, he decided to collaborate with Duncan, a Paladin in the kingdom, to overthrow the king and join the Holy Grail War to earn the Holy Grail, which is the most sacred treasure that can give a wish for whoever earns it. On the road to the kingdom, players will fight against different enemies to earn money which can be used to buy items at the checkpoints in each scene to beat the monster at the end of the scene. If players are killed, the character will be revived at the nearest checkpoint. If players die more than three times, they will lose and the game scene will be restarted.

            </p>

            <h2 id="require"> Motivation </h1>

            <p class="text" id="desciption">When I was a child, I was interested and attracted to 2D games that use pixel art such as Sonic Advance, Super Mario Bros, Pokemon, etc. After two semester studying at RMIT University, I have observed and suffered the iniquity in the university such as teammate divided tasks and gave to other teammates without asking, dictating others to do project while himself goes to the bar, copying other sources and pasting it to the report without paraphrasing, etc .Therefore, I want to make a game story based on my life’s experience combined with my passion about 2D pixel games to create Rechter and I want to use it to convey the positive and negative aspects to the new students who are going to study in university in the near future.
            </p>

            <h2 id="require" > Description </h1>

            <p class="text" id="desciption">Firstly, the story starts from a small poor village where Rechter, the main character, was born and grew up. His village was destroyed significantly because of the wars between 5 countries and the villagers slowly died due to the lack of food. In these issues, Rechter decided to go to the kingdom to work as a soldier so that he can have income to support his hometown. On his journey, he had fought a number of enemies with different levels to arrive at the kingdom. However, when he arrived in the kingdom, he met Duncan, who used to work as a Paladin for the kingdom. After talking to him, Rechter understood the ambition and cruelty of Jack, the king of the kingdom, who was fighting against 4 other kings to have the Holy Grail, a sacred treasure that will give anyone who earns it a wish, so that he could become the richest person in the world and destroy every poor village in his country. On the other hand, because of the unreasonable and cruel commands from Jack, Duncan decided to form an army to overthrow the King so as to continue the Holy Grail War to achieve treasure and restore world peace. Therefore, Rechter accepted the request from him to collaborate with one goal: beating their King and other Kings to have the Holy Grail so as to restore world peace and help the poor have a better life.

            </p>

            <p class="text" id="desciption">On launching the game file, players can see a Home Page appearing on the screen with a "Start" button located in the center. Once the user has clicked on it, they will be redirected to the "Choose Game Mode" page consisting of 3 options: "Online", where players can battle one another in real-time; "Story", where they can play as Rechter as mentioned above and "Survival", where players will attempt to survive as long as possible.. In the Online mode, players will create their own character by choosing the costume and weapon, and updating the statistics such as strength, agility, defense, etc. After creating the character, there are 2 modes for players which are 1v1 and Multiplayer. If players choose 1v1, they will join in a queue and the server will randomly assign 1 opponent to start the match. In the Story mode, the game will start and players can experience the gameplay. On the other hand, if they choose Multiplayer, they can invite from 1 to 4 friends and play against the enemies. On the Story mode, in the first scene, the game will introduce and instruct players how to move and use the weapon to attack the enemies.Also, there will be 2 checkpoints in each round so that players can buy items such as gun, arrow, shield, sword,etc.in order to strong enough to win the monster in each scene.Moreover, checkpoints will help players can quit the game anytime if they are busy or the device is lagged.Beside, players will have 3 hearts so that they can revive at the nearest checkpoint if they die and if they was killed more than three times, the game will turn to the Game over page and the round will be restarted. If players win,the screen will demonstrate the score and money that players earn and save it so that they can continue to use it in the next round. After that, players will go to the next round and continue to experience the game. In the Survival mode, players will use the character they have created in Online mode and fight against every game's enemies as long as possible to have money to equip new clothes and weapons.

            </p>

            <h2 id="require"> Tools and technologies </h1>

            <p class="text" id="desciption">Firstly, the hardware I need is a computer with a strong configuration, a mouse and a keyboard to work conveniently, a wacom to draw the game sprite such as character, tilemap, coins, weapon, etc. Secondly, I think the software that I feel is convenient and familiar to me to make the video games is Unity. Beside, the success of games depends on the quality of graphics and sound effects. Therefore, the open source tool I will use is Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Audition. Adobe Photoshop will be used to draw the pixel art for the game while Adobe Audition will be used to create and change the sounds suitable to the game.

            </p>

            <h2 id="require"> Skill required </h1>

            <p class="text" id="desciption">In order to develop Rechter, using programming languages and tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Audition are very important. In order to use Unity to develop the game, having expert in C#, which is a popular programming language, is the most vital in order to solve game problems such as move, time spawn enemies, the difficulty of each level, etc. Moreover, having mastered using tools to make sprites and sound effects is an advantage to make the game more lively and thrilling. Besides, building a well-connected storyline for the game is also essential and it is the key to make the game succeed.

            </p>

            <h2 id="require"> Outcome </h1>

            <p class="text" id="desciption">If Rechter is successful, I will be more famous in IT fields and it is a big opportunity for me to apply to many companies and have a high salary. Furthermore, I can find more developers who are interested in my game and collaborate to improve more game modes or create more skins and weapons. Also, I might continue to develop it to be a mobile app and sell it in the App Store or CH play so that everyone can play  everywhere or I may sell it with a high value to any investors who are interested in my game and want to improve it.

              <p>I think Yen’s feedback is very useful and it makes my project ideas more complete. With the observation of a future game designer, her suggestions have a high value for my idea in order to make the game not only more interesting and attractive but also meaningful in helping players’ study or other positive purposes. I totally agree with her feedback that my game brings more entertainment than other benefits which I need to improve if I want to make my game have the attention of people. In the development of the game industry, developers make games that have more value and benefits for players and if I continue to think of developing games with only entertainment purposes, my game will die and leave me a waste of time and health. In the future, I need to improve the content by making it send meaningful lessons to players, not just telling them my life’s story. </p>

                <p class="text" id="h_text">“I think your idea is compelling and it is a good choice for you to choose an indie game as your project idea. However, there are some places in the story that are a bit confusing. Moreover, if you want to bring your game to the market, you should make the content not only more appealing but also easy to understand. Furthermore, you should add Multiplayer mode in the Online mode and I believe that your game will be more valuable. Overall, your project idea is really good and if you decide to develop it, it will be a product that I look forward to playing with in the future.”

              <p>The feedback from Hai is very effective for me to complete my first project idea better. Not only pointing out the points that are not good and difficult to understand  in the content, he also gives me some tips to improve it such as explaining more specifically about bad teammates I have met through the game to convey an educational message to players. In my opinion, I strongly agree with his complaint about the content and the suggestion that I should add the Multiplayer mode on my Online mode. Reality shows that people are likely to find the games that they can play together and it is a key to make the games’ value in the market. With his feedback, I can know the weakness in my project idea to improve and make it perfect in the future.

            <h2 id="question"> What does it do?</h2>
            <p class="text" id="txt"> Talking about cloud computing, businesses nowadays are no stranger to this technology. Cloud computing is the provision of computing services through the Internet including data storage, databases,  servers, etc.  The ideas of cloud computing were first to come up in the early 1960s,  when Dr.John McCarthy, who is an American computer scientist, thought about organizations being able to use and share the data from a mainframe to everywhere. Currently, cloud computing has applications in many software applications such as Google Drive, OneDrive, Netflix, etc. After 50 years of development, cloud computing has had a number of breakthroughs, especially that users can access three services which are Software-as-a-service (SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), and Platform-as-a-service (PaaS). In 2020, 7 out of 10 organizations used cloud services to increase their income, which demonstrated the influence of Cloud computing on the globe.

            </p>

            <p class="text" id="txt"> The development of cloud computing is evidence of the benefits it brings to society. Firstly, in business, cloud computing helps enterprises save the bulk of money. In the past, before cloud computing appeared, businesses had to pay not only to build the infrastructure but also to buy servers to save the data and if they expanded more branches, they would buy more servers for each branch. If the servers were out of memories, organizations would buy a new server or hard drive in order to increase the memories. This will cost them a lot of money and if they wanted to access any data, they would have to go to the servers that store the data which they need. Therefore, cloud computing helps firms reduce the money they invest to buy servers and they can access any data they need. Secondly, thanks to cloud computing, organizations can keep the data safer than before. Back in the time when cloud computing did not appear, if companies wanted to secure the data, they would pay money to hire guards to protect the server. Cloud computing has solved this problem and it increases the protection of data better than the traditional way.  Moreover, the capabilities of data recovery of cloud computing are much better than servers. In software engineering, Cloud computing helps developers manage and boost their productivity and efficiency by providing some cloud technologies such as GitHub, Amazon Web Service (AWS), etc. These technologies also make it easier for developers to cooperate by allowing them to work together more efficiently. A prime example is Github, which is one of the most ubiquitous cloud tools for developers to manage and share their work with others. By creating a repository and inviting teammates to it, they can commit and push the code to the repository and Github will store and update the code and manage the history to show the productivity of each member through a chart.

            <p class="text" id="txt"> Even though the number of advantages of cloud computing has been witnessed in society, there are still weaknesses such as security and the delivery’s speed because data sent over the cloud must travel a long distance to reach the primary server, there will be a significant delay and a high risk of data loss and integrity. In order to avoid this issue, in the following 3 years, Edge computing, a more advanced type of Cloud computing, will be a new norm and it will reduce the capability of attacks from hackers and the time it takes for data to be transmitted. It is also the perfect technology for IoT devices to establish a massive network of many devices. Furthermore, with the appearance of 5G, which is the new network generation, the speed of Cloud computing will be improved significantly, and Cloud service performance will be improved in an unexpected way.

            <h2 id="question"> What is the likely impact? </h2>
            <p class="text" id="txt"> It is clear that there is no need to argue the significant effect of Cloud computing on the development of society in many fields.  In the Business area, thanks to Cloud computing, a number of companies have converted their work to cloud and it is especially convenient when the world situation is terrible because of the Covid pandemic. Employees can stay home, work, and submit through cloud service after finishing firm tasks. Moreover, through Cloud applications such as Zoom, Google Meeting, or Microsoft Teams, employees are able to contact each other by creating a meeting room to talk and report their work. Also, the memory storage of the cloud helps enterprises reduce costs for hard drives, USBs, Memory Cards, etc.


            </p>

            <p class="text" id="txt"> With the development of Cloud computing, it is no exaggeration to say the benefits of Cloud will help Cloud applications become a norm in the future. With the short time and little investment in IT infrastructure, the high reliability,  easy to manage the system with high security, the fast installing’ s speed in any device, it is clear that the traditional software applications are going to be replaced by Cloud applications.

            </p>

            <p class="text" id="txt"> Furthermore, Cloud computing also influences the development of AI applications in the AI industry. A prime example is a Teachable Machine, which is a cloud-based tool developed by Google [5]. Specifically, each user will have their own machine learning model and train them. The model will save the data which is the images describing the acts recorded and given a name by users so that the model can recognize what users do in the future. Moreover, in the newest versions, the model can also identify the voice and poses of users [6].

            </p>

            <p class="text" id="txt"> In a variety of ways, cloud computing will have a significant influence on many sectors of society. In the Education area, Cloud applications such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams will commonly be used for teaching and teachers need to adapt to this alteration and prepare a suitable teaching plan. In the coming years, occupations related to Cloud computing will strongly increase and employees need to be ready to adapt or be eliminated [7].

            </p>

            <h2 id="question"> How will this affect you? </h2>
            <p class="text" id="txt"> In my daily life, Cloud computing plays an essential part and it is difficult for me to get rid of it. Thanks to the alteration of Cloud, a number of efficient tools have appeared and it is my chance to use and improve my study and my social life.  In my study, Cloud computing helps my documentations be safe and reduce the computer’s memory so that I can install more software applications supporting my study. By working and saving documents in the Cloud, I can do exercises and write reports everywhere even if I only have a smartphone and the Internet. In the past, I used to have a friend and he tried to access my computer and steal the report that I did in order to submit it to school. Luckily, I worked and stored the reports in Google Drive and he did not know not only the place of the reports but also the password to access my Google Drive. Therefore, thanks to cloud computing, I have an extra safe place to keep my documents secure . Moreover, some cloud-based applications such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) can help developers build products efficiently and affordably and it will be a helpful tool for me in the future. Furthermore, texting applications such as Messenger, Line, Snapchat, etc, will have more benefits due to the development of cloud services. The quality of communication such as the speed of sending messages and the lag of devices while my friends and I are calling will be improved significantly.  Also, some social media applications such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc, can not develop and become popular if there is no cloud computing.

            </p>

            <p class="text" id="txt"> On the other hand, in the Covid pandemic, Cloud computing not only helps my parents work online and have income but also spends more time talking together and caring for me. Moreover, cloud services can apply in healthcare in order to manage the health statistics of  patients or the elderly such as my parents and my grandmother.

              <h2 id="question"> What does it do?</h2>
              <p class="text" id="txt"> In recent years, in the development of technology, people are no stranger to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning. To begin with, Artificial intelligence is the act of machines such as computer systems that imitates the act of humans [1]. On the other hand, Machine learning is an AI’s application that can develop itself by automatically studying and improving the experience through the development of computer systems by accessing the computer’s data and using it to learn for themselves [2]. The term “Artificial Intelligence” first appeared in the 1950s after Alan Turing, who is a young British polymath, suggested that people can solve issues and make decisions so why can not machines do the same thing [3]? The next 2 years, the term “Machine Learning” appeared after Arthur Samuel, an American computer scientist, thought about developing a computer program for playing checkers that could remember all positions it had observed [4]. The development of AI and Machine learning makes a positive change to society. It helps people solve problems faster, calculate, analyze data and give predictions for people with high accuracy.


              </p>

              <p class="text" id="txt"> Over the past few decades, the improvement of AI and Machine learning has affected society’s activities significantly. A number of businesses in many fields are willing to spend a billion dollars for AI and Machine learning for different purposes. For instance, Google Maps was developed by Where 2 Technologies until Google saw the potential and decided to buy the whole company in order to develop it; thus, at the moment, Google Maps has become an essential part with many drivers. Moreover, AI and Machine learning can also be used in some games such as Chess, Hello Neighbor, etc, in order to make enemies remember players’ solutions so that the game becomes more difficult and unpredictable. In Business fields, AI is used to make chat-bots and it helps companies resolve problems including customers’ complaints, place orders, etc [5]. Furthermore, AI and Machine learning has applied and developed in healthcare for a long time so as to help doctors diagnose diseases and evolve drugs to prevent different sicknesses and epidemics [6].

              </p>

              <p class="text" id="txt"> It can not be denied that the development of AI and Machine learning has a huge impact on the alteration in the world. In the following 3 years, AI will be extended and developed in a number of areas such as movies, cybersecurity, transportation, etc. For example, AI can apply to Netflix and the watchers can create their own custom movies by choosing the virtual actors and scenes that they like, and AI will rely on it to analyze and build a suitable storyline [7]. If AI guesses the films have a high capability to succeed, the studio might release it and have income; thus, the studios not only reduce the cost of hiring actors but also have revenue. On the other hand, the improvement of hackers has made cyberattacks become one of the most struggling issues that many organizations are nervous about. With the ability of automatic self-studying through the data in the computer, AI will be the key to prevent hackers and protect the data safely [8]. Furthermore, with AI, transportation such as trains, cars, planes, etc, will no longer need drivers in the future because AI will replace drivers and drive automatically [10].


              </p>

              <p class="text" id="txt">In order to make the future of AI and machine learning possible, some technologies and developments are needed from humans. Firstly, developers need to improve the algorithm using AI and machine learning stronger. Moreover, because AI and machine learning only act like humans, there should be added emotional recognition functions that will allow them to determine how to treat individuals depending on their present mood.

              </p>

              <h2 id="question"> What is the likely impact? </h2>
              <p class="text" id="txt"> It can not be denied that the impact of AI and Machine learning has helped those technologies become potential in society. In economics, thanks to AI and Machine Learning, productivity and efficiency have increased and it is the premise to have more profit. A piece of prime evidence is the revenue of government and businesses in the Middle East which is about 320 million USD and it is expected to increase 2% total world benefits of AI by 2030 [11]. Moreover, in recent years, many household appliances and transportation have been applied to AI which demonstrates that AI and Machine learning brings alteration to our lives. For instance, with the benefits of voice recognition, AI and Machine learning are used to make the doors that will automatically open when people say the password. Another example is the self-driving cars which will drive when people speak or give the location to them.

              </p>

              <p class="text" id="txt"> The alteration of AI & Machine learning to human daily life will help people build a neat and orderly lifestyle. In the future, AI can be used in some items such as watches, earphones, smartphones, etc, and work as an assistant for users. By setting users’ daily routine or schedule, the items will be remembered and when the time comes, they will remind people to do the task. Moreover, it can be seen that supermarkets, as well as convenience stores, spend a hefty amount of their profit on importing products and employing cashiers and workers. Therefore, investing in AI and Machine learning can help those supermarkets and grocery stores reduce the money spent for hiring shop assistants and increase productivity.

              </p>

              <p class="text" id="txt"> Even though AI and Machine learning makes social change and adapts their improvement, they might significantly affect people who are low-tech and poor. Moreover, it can also influence children and teenagers in two ways. The positive way is that they will easily adapt to it while the harm is that they will live dependent on it. For example, when children live too dependent on AI and Machine learning, and one day there is no AI and Machine learning in the world, they will face many problems such as controlling their routine, studying, etc.

              </p>

              <p class="text" id="txt"> Despite the benefits of AI and Machine learning, it might cause some disadvantages for people. For instance, with AI and Machine learning, organizations are no longer hiring people, making the unemployed rate grow. Furthermore, if AI and Machine learning have errors, the production process will be stopped and it causes the loss of the company’s income and profits.

              </p>

              <h2 id="question"> How will this affect you? </h2>
              <p class="text" id="txt"> In my opinion, the development of AI and Machine learning will greatly influence me in the near future. Firstly, it helps me improve my productivity and efficiency in my study. For instance, when I have difficulty in my study, I can ask AI and Machine learning to help me through voice recognition and it will give me the solutions to solve the problem. Moreover, my learning style can be changed in a flexible way so that I can both study and play sports more than now. By setting my daily routine, AI and Machine learning will remind me to do the tasks. Also, I will apply AI and Machine learning to my home in order to improve security.

              </p>

              <p class="text" id="txt"> Honestly, with the increasing speed of the improvement of AI and Machine learning, my life will be changed significantly in the future. In order to catch up with the trend, I will have to spend a lot of money on those technologies, and the useful functions will support me to promote myself and save a lot of time. For instance, usually, I have to have breakfast before I drive to school. But now, with the support of AI, my motorbike will drive itself and I can deliberately have breakfast. Also, because I am an IT student, it will help me have more chances to discover and understand more about AI and Machine learning.


              </p>

              <p class="text" id="txt"> On the other hand, the change of AI and Machine learning will greatly affect my parents, especially my father. To be honest, while my mother can easily learn and use them,  my father is a low-tech person and it will make me spend a lot of time instructing him how to use those technologies and explaining the benefits. After that, he will use and slightly adapt it. After using it for a long time, it will become familiar to him and when I teach him to use other equipment, he will learn it faster and easier than before.
